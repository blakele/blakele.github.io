# About Me
I'm Blake Le, and I am a 4th year student at Oregon State University studying computer science with a focus on data science.
I'm very interested in different ways to interpret and display data as well as learning from it, specifically the fields of data visualization, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Some languages I have experience using are Python, C, C++, Intelx86 Assembly, SQL, and Java.
I've had experience in a few graphics frameworks and elements such as OpenMP, CUDA, SIMD, and OpenCL.
## Projects
#### Plant Life Monitor
During the 32 hour hackathon Hweekend, I along with 3 other people created a device which senses and regulates a house plant's humidity, temperature, and light absorption.
This was done using multiple sensors interacting synchronously through an arduino. My part for the project was connecting the circuitry for the sensors
and programming them to detect and respond to changes to their enviornment. 
Our team won the Innovation X award for this project, which is awarded to the team with the best working prototype.
#### DataVis website
Created a website that helps data visualization experts receive crowdsourced feedback on their visualizations using APIs from Qualtrics, and Amazon Mturks, and ASP.NET for the website framework. Worked on the front end, outfitting the website with a bootstrap theme, made landing, and 400 error pages.
